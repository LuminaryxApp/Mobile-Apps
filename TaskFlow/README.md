# TaskFlow

A task manager app that keeps things simple but useful.

## What it does

I built this because most todo apps are either too basic or way too complicated. TaskFlow hits the sweet spot - you can create tasks, set priorities, organize them into categories, and actually see your progress.

The home screen shows all your tasks with a nice progress card at the top. You can filter between active and completed tasks, or search for something specific.

Categories let you group related tasks together. Pick an icon and color for each one, and you'll see at a glance how much you've done in each area.

There's also a stats page that shows your completion rate, current streak, and breaks things down by priority and category. It's surprisingly motivating to see those numbers go up.

## Features

- Create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities

# My Mobile Apps

Three React Native apps I built to showcase my mobile development skills. Each one solves a real problem and focuses on clean design and smooth user experience.

## The Apps

**TaskFlow** - A task manager that actually helps you get things done. Create tasks, organize them into categories, and track your progress over time.

**PhotoVault** - A photo gallery app for organizing your pictures. Create albums, favorite the ones you love, and browse through everything in a clean grid.

**WeatherPulse** - Check the weather for any city with a beautiful interface. Save your favorite locations and see forecasts at a glance.

## Running the Apps

Each app runs through Expo, so you just need to:

1. Go into any app folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Scan the QR code with your phone

That's it - no complicated setup needed.

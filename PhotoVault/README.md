# PhotoVault

A photo gallery app with a clean, modern look.

## What it does

PhotoVault is all about organizing and viewing your photos in a way that feels good. The main gallery shows your photos in a grid, but you can switch to a list view if you prefer seeing them with dates.

You can create albums to keep things organized - vacation photos, family stuff, whatever makes sense to you. Just tap and hold to add a photo to an album, or do it from the full-screen viewer.

Speaking of the viewer, tapping any photo opens it full screen. From there you can favorite it, add it to an album, or delete it. The controls hide when you tap the photo so you can just enjoy looking at it.

The favorites section keeps all your best photos in one place. Quick access to the stuff you actually want to see again.

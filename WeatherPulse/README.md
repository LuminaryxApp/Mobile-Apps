# WeatherPulse

A weather app that looks good and tells you what you need to know.

## What it does

WeatherPulse shows you the weather in a way that's easy to understand at a glance. The main screen has a big card with the current temperature and conditions, plus the important stuff like humidity and wind speed.

Below that you get an hourly forecast you can scroll through, and a 7-day outlook so you can plan ahead. The background colors change based on the weather, which is a nice touch.

You can search for pretty much any major city and save your favorites for quick access. Switching between locations is just a tap away. There's also a toggle for Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on what you're used to.

The saved locations screen shows you a quick preview of the weather in each city, so you can check multiple places without hunting around.
